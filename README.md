## Final Project for MSP432PXX Using Code Composer Studio


# Overview
** This project implements a GPIO-based tilt sensor and inclinometer using the MSP432PXX Robot Microcontroller. The tilt sensor detects the orientation of the system and controls the built-in red LED, RGB LED, and motors accordingly.

# Prerequisites:
Code Composer Studio
MSP432PXX Robot Microcontroller
Tilt sensor module
Motor driver module
RGB LED module
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tilt-sensor-project.git
Open the project in Code Composer Studio.
Hardware Setup
Connect the MSP432PXX Microcontroller to your computer.
Connect the tilt sensor to the designated pins on Port 4 (P4.0, P4.2, P4.4, P4.5).
Connect the motor driver to the appropriate ports.
Connect the RGB LED module to the designated pins on Port 2 (P2.0 - P2.2).
Power on the MSP432PXX Microcontroller.
Software Setup
Build the project in Code Composer Studio.
Flash the compiled code onto the MSP432PXX Microcontroller.
Usage
Run the compiled code on the MSP432PXX Microcontroller.
Observe the behavior of the built-in red LED, RGB LED, and motors based on the tilt sensor readings.

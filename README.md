## Final Project for MSP432PXX Using Code Composer Studio

# Overview
** This project implements a GPIO-based tilt sensor and inclinometer using the MSP432PXX Robot Microcontroller. The tilt sensor detects the orientation of the system and controls the built-in red LED, RGB LED, and motors accordingly.
See notes of the powerpoint for issues and detailed information.

# Prerequisites:
**Code Composer Studio**

**MSP432PXX Robot Microcontroller**

**Tilt sensor module**

**Motor driver module(included onboard microcontroller)**

**RGB LED module(included onboard microcontroller)**

# Getting Started

**1. Clone this repository to your local machine:**
**Note: Replace "yourusername" in the clone command with your GitHub username.**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tilt-sensor-project.git
```
**2. Open the project in Code Composer Studio.**

**3. Set up the Hardware (See Below).**

**4. Set up the Software (See Below).**

# Hardware Setup
**1. Connect the MSP432PXX Microcontroller to your computer.**
**2. Connect the tilt sensor to the designated pins on Port 4 (P4.0, P4.2, P4.4, P4.5).**
**3. Connect the motor driver to the appropriate ports.**
**4. Connect the RGB LED module to the designated pins on Port 2 (P2.0 - P2.2).**
**5. Power on the MSP432PXX Microcontroller.**

# Software Setup
**1. Build the project in Code Composer Studio.**
**2. Flash or Debug the compiled code onto the MSP432PXX Microcontroller.**
**3. Any issues might be related to needing to set the appropriate BAUD rate on Windows.**

# Usage
**Run the compiled code on the MSP432PXX Microcontroller.**
**Observe the behavior of the built-in red LED, RGB LED, and motors based on the tilt sensor readings.**
